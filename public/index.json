However, Seligman (2018) suggested the original five building blocks are highly predictive of well-being but certainly not exhaustive. This research attempted to expand the PERMA model in the workplace with four new building blocks of well-being - physical health, mindset, environment, and economic security. Study 1 utilized nine subject matter experts (SMEs) to content analyze and evaluate an item pool for scale development. In Study 2 (N=300), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) extrapolated nine dimensions of positive functioning at work (PF-W) with a random sample of full-time employees recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The purpose of Study 3 was to validate the PF-W scale and test its ability to predict work outcomes. Findings from 727 full-time employees supported a general factor of PF-W with nine lower-order dimensions. The measure exhibited convergent, discriminant, criterion, predictive, and incremental forms of validity with other well-being (Diener 1985; Luthans, Youssef and Avolio 2007) and performance measures (Griffin, Neal and Parker 2007), as well as measurement invariance across job function. The Positive Functioning at Work Scale provides a comprehensive measurement tool that can inform future workplace programs and interventions. It also predicts important work outcomes, such as turnover intentions, job-related affective well-being, plus individual, team, and organizational adaptivity, proactivity, and organizational proficiency.","tags":["Featured"],"title":"The Positive Functioning at Work Scale: Psychometric Assessment, Validation, and Measurement Invariance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Scott I.

One area of inquiry within the PWO approach involves designing and evaluating positive psychology interventions (PPIs) at work. The current research used a multi-phase exploratory sequential mixed method design to evaluate the effectiveness of PPIs at work using process evaluation, and tested a framework of employee positive functioning expanding on Seligman’s PERMA Theory of Well-Being (Seligman, 2011). Four related studies were carried out examining the fidelity, quality of implementation, and effectiveness of 22 PPIs at work, and testing the validity of a new Employee Positive Functioning (EPF) scale with more than 1,000 full-time employees. The ability of the EPF Scale to predict important work outcomes was also examined. Taken together, these studies show that PPIs implemented at work can be effective at improving employee well-being and organizational performance. They also show that the EPF scale exhibited convergent, discriminant, criterion, predictive, and incremental forms of validity with other well-being and performance measures, as well as measurement invariance across job functions. In addition, the EPF scale was predictive of important work outcomes, such as turnover intentions, job-related affective well-being, and individual, team, and organizational adaptivity, proactivity, and organizational proficiency. It is recommended that organizations consider using the validated EPF scale to determine the specific needs of their workforce, and to use this needs assessment to help tailor positive psychology interventions to be more effective in work settings. The benefits of multicomponent PPIs and the theoretical and practical implications of this study for the design and evaluation of future PPIs at work are discussed.","tags":["Recent"],"title":" Evaluating Employee Positive Functioning and Performance: A Positive Work and Organizations Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Scott I.

We draw from streams of PWO, including positive organizational scholarship (POS), positive organizational behavior (POB) and positive organizational psychology literature (POP) to evaluate PPIs at work. The meta-analytic findings from 22 studies showed that the five workplace positive psychology interventions had a small positive effect on improving desirable work outcomes (g = .25), and a small to moderate effect on reducing undesirable work outcomes (g = −.34).

One aspect of PWO includes positive psychology interventions (PPI’s) at work, which uses the theory and scholarship of positive work and organizations to design interventions aimed at improving employee work outcomes. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Donaldson, Lee, and Donaldson (under review) found a link between PPI’s at work and improving desirable and reducing undesirable work outcomes. The purpose of this chapter was to synthesize the empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these interventions using a theory-driven evaluation (TDE) approach. TDE refers to the systematic use of substantive knowledge (i.e., social science theory, stakeholder theory, or some combination of both) about the intervention under consideration to improve, produce knowledge, or determine its merit, value, and worth (Donaldson, 2007). We found that positive psychology theories, intervention delivery methods, types of participants, and contexts in which these interventions are implemented determines the efficacy of their outcomes. The findings will have implications for enhancing the effectiveness of future interventions as well as provide valuable information for practitioners deciding to use PPI’s in their organizations.","tags":["Recent"],"title":"The Effectiveness of Positive Psychology Interventions in the Workplace: A Theory-Driven Evaluation Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meg Warren","Dr. Scott I.

A positive work and organizations perspective has the capacity to augment problem‐focused gender research with new approaches to boosting gender equity. Yet, contributions that utilize such a perspective are sparsely spread across nearly two decades’ time and dozens of journals with differing disciplinary foci. This paper aims to reinvigorate gender research in management research by consolidating insights that have emerged through the application of a positive perspective. Therefore, we systematically review articles published in 21 management and psychological journals between 2001 and 2016. Four main themes emerged as drivers of gender research from a positive perspective -  performance, social integration, well‐being, and justice/moral matters. The contributions within these themes highlight pathways to organizational flourishing through positive diversity and inclusion behaviors and practices. Thus, this paper provides a conceptual map for navigating and planning further research.","tags":["Featured"],"title":"Reinvigorating Research on Gender in the Workplace Using a Positive Work and Organizations Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

This study provides recent views on major topics in professionalization, including potential benefits, negative side effects, processes, competencies, and procedures. Results from in-depth interviews and an online survey demonstrate that AEA members view potential benefits of professionalization to be stakeholder trust, evaluator reputation and identity, while concerns about a potential negative side effect known as the “narrowing effect” (i.e., some evaluators will be alienated based on their background, competencies, etc.) were expressed by participants. These recent findings can inform the ongoing discussion of professionalization, and suggest new directions for future research on evaluation.","tags":["Recent"],"title":"Where Do We Stand?

Yet, in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, many hurdles preclude the development and maintenance of professional organizations, such as a lack of understanding of the range of services available within psychology, little professional oversight and no legal mandate for it, as well as a disinterest in professionalizing the field. Yet, by adopting a positive psychology framework, the current view from a focus on wrongdoing to a more positive approach that encourages psychologists to reach a state of professional excellence, can be accomplished via the notion of positive supervision, positive ethics, and virtuousness as an organizational trait.

Anecdotal evidence suggests many practicing evaluators have experienced IP feelings, but have lacked an empirical framework to help understand their experiences as well as a forum to discuss them.  This paper summarizes the literature on the impostor phenomenon, applies it to the field of evaluation, and describes the results of an empirical quantitatively focused study which included open-ended qualitative questions that explored IP in 313 practicing evaluators.  The results suggest IP in evaluators is comprised of four constructs (discount, luck, fake, and discount/luck interaction).  Qualitative data analysis suggests differential coping strategies for men and women.  Thematic analysis guided the development of a set of proposed solutions to help lessen IPs detrimental effects for evaluators.","tags":["Forthcoming"],"title":"Addressing the Elephant in the Room: Exploring the Impostor Phenomenon in Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As a Post-Doctoral Scholar at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, I advanced my transdisciplinary research interests in evaluation, statistics, and measurement by designing a grant electronic monitoring and evaluation software system for a statewide behavioral health intervention in California.

The current study used multitrait-multimethod analyses to examine the relationship between positive work and organizations constructs PERMA+4 and work role performance (adaptivity, proactivity, and proficiency) beyond self-report and monomethod bias. Findings from 221 coworker pairs demonstrated strong positive convergence between self-reported and collateral-reported PERMA+4 (r  .85) and work role performance (r.85), including organizational adaptivity (r  .71), organizational proactivity (r  .68), and organizational proficiency (r  .73). PERMA+4 was also a significant predictor of overall work role performance. A multitrait-multimethod matrix showed that monomethod trait interrelationships were systematically higher than heteromethod trait interrelationships with inflated correlations ranging from .07 to .20. Monomethod parameter estimates and coefficients of determination were generally higher than in bias corrected self-reports, knowledgeable collateral-reports, and heteromethod parameter estimates. The results provide support for the validity of the relationship between PERMA+4 and work role performance, and suggest the importance of including procedural design and statistical control methods in workplace surveys to correct for self-report and monomethod bias.","tags":["Forthcoming"],"title":"Examining PERMA+4 and Work Role Performance beyond Self-Report Bias: Insights from Multitrait-Multimethod Analyses","type":"publication"}]
