  description: Some of the main topics in my lecture and lab sequence included -measures of central tendency, analysis of variance, applied multiple regression, data visualization, and the use of statistical software packages (e.g.,SPSS). The underlying logic of my statistics course was to help students formulate questions that data can answer, carry out appropriate statistical tests, and convey a story with data that lay people could understand.
