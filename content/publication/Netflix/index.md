abstract: Research is needed to understand the frequency of e-cigarette impressions in scripted television and movies, especially in scripted content with characters and storylines that may appeal to young adults. This study aimed to determine the extent of e-cigarette-related imagery and dialogue in Netflix content popular with young adults. We also determine the demographics and character qualities of actors shown holding e-cigarettes.
