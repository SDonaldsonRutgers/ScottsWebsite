**Evaluating Health Promotion Programs**

> ***How can we best design individual, workplace, and community-based health promotion programs to improve well-being and prevent lifestyle diseases?***

This research question spurred me to systematically review and meta-analyze over 20 years' worth of intervention research that examined positive functioning and performance outcomes (Donaldson et al., 2019). Across 6,027 employees representing 10 nations, I showed that five workplace interventions had a small positive effect on improving desirable outcomes, and a small to moderate effect on reducing undesirable outcomes. I also developed and validated my own scale of Positive Functioning at Work to contribute to the design and measurement of such interventions (Donaldson, 2019; Donaldson & Donaldson, 2021). The Positive Functioning at Work Scale provides a comprehensive measurement tool that can inform future workplace health promotion programs and interventions. It also predicts important performance outcomes, such as turnover intentions, job related affective well-being, plus individual, team, and organizational adaptivity, proactivity, and organizational proficiency.

**Statistical Computing and Advanced Analytics in R**

> ***My research utilizes R to conduct cutting-edge methodologies, such as item response theory, factor analytic methods, multitrait-multimethod analyses, and interactive dashboards to improve health outcomes.***

My doctoral dissertation evaluated the psychometric properties of Positive Functioning at Work using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multiple regression to establish incremental and criterion validity (Donaldson, 2019; Donaldson & Donaldson, 2021). Some of my other scale work includes validating a measure of imposter phenomenon in organizations (Lavelle, Donaldson, & Jones, in press). I am also interested in exploring the role of employee self-report and monomethod bias using multitrait-multimethod analyses. In sample of 220 coworker pairs, I found that positive functioning significantly predicted life satisfaction above and beyond self-report and mono-method bias (Donaldson et al., 2019). This was one of the first empirical studies to test Positive Functioning at Work beyond the sole use of self-reports, and illustrates that Positive Functioning can be a strong predictor of well-being. In my organizational consulting practice, I attempt to produce data-driven insights for my clients, some of which include companies such as Accenture. For example, I build data visualizations and analytic dashboards based on implementation and outcome intervention data so that human resource managers can easily use the information to make evidence-based decisions. My philosophy of practice is spring boarded on a storytelling narrative of data that makes findings digestible to clients that may not have a background in quantitative methodologies.
