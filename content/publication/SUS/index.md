abstract: Puff Bar has rapidly captured a large proportion of the disposable e-cigarette market. To stay abreast of the rapidly changing e-cigarette-product landscape, researchers have turned to social media platforms to monitor e-cigarette-related discussions and marketing trends. TikTok is the latest social media platform to capture the attention of adolescents and young adults; however, e-cigarette-related research using TikTok is limited.
