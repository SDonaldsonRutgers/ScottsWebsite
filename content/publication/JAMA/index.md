abstract: Is there an association between exposure to tobacco content on social media and tobacco use? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 studies showed that participants who were exposed to tobacco content on social media, compared with those who were not exposed, had greater odds of reporting lifetime tobacco use, past 30-day tobacco use, and susceptibility to use tobacco among never users.Findings suggest that a comprehensive strategy to reduce the amount of tobacco content on social media should be developed by federal regulators; such actions may have downstream effects on adolescent and young adult exposure to protobacco content, and ultimately tobacco use behaviors.
