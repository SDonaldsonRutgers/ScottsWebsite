Scott I. Donaldson, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of General Internal Medicine in the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and a core faculty member of the Rutgers Institute for Nicotine & Tobacco Studies. He also holds a faculty position at the University of Connecticut in Research Methods, Measurement, and Evaluation. 

Dr. Donaldson has developed a track record of monitoring and evaluating the tobacco product and marketing landscape in the online environment. For example, his social media surveillance has described the kinds of pro-e-cigarette and little cigar content on TikTok, and has shown how e-cigarette brands promote their products on YouTube. Additionally, his novel direct-to-consumer marketing surveillance has described the content and features of tobacco websites and email communications, and shown how minors can easily enter websites and attempt to purchase products. Dr. Donaldson has also published several review papers covering the tobacco and social media landscape, and has written a viewpoint calling for prevention programs to incorporate tobacco-related digital media literacy. 

Dr. Donaldson's research uses advanced quantitative methodologies, such as psychometrics approaches like classical test theory and item response theory, to develop and validate behavioral scales, perform meta-analyses, and use multitrait-multimethod analyses on health-related topics. He has published articles that have appeared in top journals including JAMA Pediatrics, JAMA Network Open, and Tobacco Control, and received media attention from many news and policy outlets, such as the U.S. News & World Report, NBC Los Angeles, and the World & Health Organization.
