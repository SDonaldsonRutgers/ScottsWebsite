**Evaluating Workplace Programs and Interventions**

> ***How can we best design organizational interventions to improve employee positive functioning and performance?***

This research question spurred me to systematically review and meta-analyze over 20 years' worth of organizational intervention research that examined positive functioning and work performance outcomes (Donaldson et al., 2019ab). Across 6,027 employees representing 10 nations, I showed that five workplace interventions had a small positive effect on improving desirable performance outcomes, and a small to moderate effect on reducing undesirable performance outcomes. I also developed and validated my own scale of Positive Functioning at Work to contribute to the design and measurement of such interventions (Donaldson, 2019; Donaldson & Donaldson, 2021). The Positive Functioning at Work Scale provides a comprehensive measurement tool that can inform future workplace health promotion programs and interventions. It also predicts important performance outcomes, such as turnover intentions, job related affective well-being, plus individual, team, and organizational adaptivity, proactivity, and organizational proficiency. As an Assistant Professor, I will continue to develop a program of research and practice that builds data-driven best practices in the design, implementation, and assessment of organizational interventions.

**People Analytics in R**

> ***My research utilizes R to perform quantitative analytic methods applied to the workplace, such as item response theory, factor analytic methods, multitrait-multimethod analyses, and interactive dashboards to conduct research and consulting.***

My doctoral dissertation evaluated the psychometric properties of Positive Functioning at Work using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multiple regression to establish incremental and criterion validity (Donaldson, 2019; Donaldson & Donaldson, 2021). Some of my other scale work includes validating a measure of imposter phenomenon in organizations (Lavelle, Donaldson, & Jones, in press). I am also interested in exploring the role of employee self-report and monomethod bias using multitrait-multimethod analyses. In sample of 220 coworker pairs, I found that positive functioning significantly predicted life satisfaction above and beyond self-report and mono-method bias (Donaldson et al., 2019). This was one of the first empirical studies to test Positive Functioning at Work beyond the sole use of self-reports, and illustrates that Positive Functioning can be a strong predictor of well-being. In my organizational consulting practice, I attempt to produce data-driven insights for my clients, some of which include companies such as Accenture. For example, I build data visualizations and analytic dashboards based on implementation and outcome intervention data so that human resource managers can easily use the information to make evidence-based decisions. My philosophy of practice is spring boarded on a storytelling narrative of data that makes findings digestible to clients that may not have a background in quantitative methodologies.

**Future Directions**

My program of research measures the positive functioning and performance of employees, teams, and organizations. As a new faculty member, I will immediately pursue grant opportunities focused on applied business analytics in R through the application of advanced quantitative statistical techniques. I plan to grow my current program of research and practice by a) using my platform as President-Elect of the International Positive Psychology Association Work and Organizations division to develop standards of continuous quality improvement for implementation, measurement, and assessment of organizational interventions, and I plan to enhance partnerships between practitioners and academics to collaborate on joint projects; b) designing a comprehensive Positive Functioning intervention in the workplace, as well as a theory-driven framework to monitor and evaluate findings, and c) continue research and scholarship on scale validation and measurement in management.
