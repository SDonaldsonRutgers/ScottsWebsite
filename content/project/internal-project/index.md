As a Post-Doctoral Scholar at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, I advanced my transdisciplinary research interests in evaluation, statistics, and measurement by designing a grant electronic monitoring and evaluation software system for a statewide behavioral health intervention in California. Under the supervision of world-renowned Chinese scientist Shu-Hong Zhu, I conducted a comprehensive theory-driven evaluation of an evidence-based education program with $60 million in allocated funds from the California Department of Education. Our real-time monitoring, evaluation, and technical assistance approach integrated continuous quality improvement to help design, measure, and evaluate the impact of a multi-tiered socioecological prevention program.
