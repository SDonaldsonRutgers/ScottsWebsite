abstract: Little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs) are popular tobacco products among youth (ie, adolescents and young adults). A variety of LCC-related promotional and user-generated content is present on social media. However, research on LCC-related posts on social media has been largely focused on platforms that are primarily text- or image-based, such as Twitter and Instagram.
